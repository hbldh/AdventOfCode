Solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016), written
in Python, compliant with both version 2.7 and 3.5.

To run problem solvers, run the `run.py` script in the Python interpreter:

```
$ python run.py --help

Execute all days by omitting any number arguments 
(*Note that Day 11 solution takes about 3-5 minutes!*), or specify a subset of
days by integer values as input. Add the `--token` argument if you want the
solution runner to download input data from the website as well:

$ python run.py --token 53616c[...]
```
